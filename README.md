# Overview
Watchqueue is a web application desinged for creating and managing the things you want to watch.
All movie data is from TheMovieDatabase or TMDB.

Watchqueue is currently not hosted anywhere. I will host it in the future but as of now, you have to [run it locally](README#Installation) if you want to use it.
